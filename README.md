# MINI-PROJECT

For emergency service providers, giving their service in least time shows their best
performance. Emergency hospitals will be at their best if the ambulance reaches the site
in Golden hour where life of injured persons can be saved. ambulance uses the road
network to reach the accident site. but now roads are so congested that it difficult for the
Ambulance drivers to travel and reach the accident. many people lose their life on the
way as they are not able to reach the hospital on time. people are not aware that the
ambulance is on the way until they hear the noise on the road thus it becomes difficult
for traffic officials also to control the situation, thus our app becomes effective platform
to resolve this issue to certain extent as it helps to monitor, control, optimize, and
operate traffic in urban areas
